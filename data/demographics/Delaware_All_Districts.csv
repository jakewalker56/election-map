Source: 2015 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates,,,,,,,,
Estimates in the People, Workers, Housing, Socioeconomic, and Education tabs are from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an annual household survey developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to replace the long form of the decennial census program. Each year, the ACS samples about 3.5 million household addresses to produce nearly 11 billion estimates covering demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics.
Except where noted, 'race' refers to people reporting only one race.  'Hispanic' refers to an ethnic category;  Hispanics may be of any race.,,,,,,,
An '**' entry in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.,,,,,,,,
An '-' entry in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution.,,,,,,,
An '-' following a median estimate means the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution.,,,,,,,,
An '+' following a median estimate means the median falls in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution.,,,,,,,,
An '***' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.,,,,,,,,
An '*****' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate.,,,,,,,,
An 'N' entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.,,,,,,,,
An '(X)' means that the estimate is not applicable or not available,,,,,,,,
If calculating a percentage, use the total population line within the section as the denominator. Do not use total population lines from other sections since these may have different universes.,,,,,,,
Source: 2015 County Business Patterns for Congressional Districts,,,,,,,,
1. CBP data includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, and annual payroll. CBP basic data are extracted from the Business Register (BR), a database of all known single and multi-establishment employer companies maintained and updated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Primary causes of differences between CBP employment estimates and ACS estimates: CBP does not cover the self-employed, public employment, and most agricultural employment; CBP estimates are not based on a sample survey; they represent business location as opposed to workers' residence in the district; use the week of March 12 as a reference period; and use a business source to determine industry.,,,
2. Industries not classified - Industry could not be determined.,,,,,,,,
3. Statewide - CBP data includes employers without a fixed location within a state (or of unknown county location), these are included under a statewide classification. Statewide cases are withheld from the tabulation for this My Congressional District tool. This incomplete detail causes only a slight understatement of a district's total estimates. Statewide cases do not apply to at-large districts.,,,,,,,
4. If a sector does not appear in a district, CBP did not identify any establishments in the district.,,,,,,,
5. Disclosure and Quality Indicator Flag Definitions:,,,,,,,,
D Withheld to avoid disclosing data for individual companies; data are included in higher level totals,,,,,,,,
G Cell value changed by less than 2 percent by the application of noise,,,,,,,,
H Cell value changed by at least 2 percent but less than 5 percent by the application of noise,,,,,,,,
S Cell value withheld because it did not meet publication standards,,,,,,,,
N Not available or not comparable,,,,,,,,
X Not applicable,,,,,,,,
a 0 to 19 employees,,,,,,,,
b 20 to 99 employees,,,,,,,,
c 100 to 249 employees,,,,,,,,
e 250 to 499 employees,,,,,,,,
f 500 to 999 employees,,,,,,,,
g 1,000 to 2,499 employees,,,,,,
h 2,500 to 4,999 employees,,,,,,
i 5,000 to 9,999 employees,,,,,,
j 10,000 to 24,999 employees,,,,,,
l 50,000 to 99,999 employees,,,,,,
